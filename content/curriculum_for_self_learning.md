Summary: How I design my own curriculum for Self-Learning. My simple strategy to keep track of everything and always have something ready to work on.


After deciding to pursue a degree in Artificial Intelligence, and with my never-ending list of things I would like to learn, I resolved to teach myself using online resources. This is a first draft of the courses and resources I plan to use, it includes a variety of subjecs from basic to advance to get started in a myriad of topics.


##My Goals

* __Explore new fields__: Probably my main reason for self-study. The world of Computer Science is full of exciting topics, some of which I am curious about, like Deep Learning applied to Medicine, Bioinformatics, Functional Programming, MLOps. 
* __Bring value to my current job__: Improving my knowledge in Python and SQL, or getting started with AIOps.
* __Improve my toolkit__: Polishing my skills with vim, awk, bash, etc.

## How I keep track?
I tried to tackle courses and books one by one, from start to finish, but this strategy didn't work very well for me. What I do now instead is try to mix different resources, I found that sometimes they reinforce each other and I can learn better. For example, Michael Nielsen's 'NN and DL' book is a great complement for the fast.ai course. And both have common topics with any other Machine Learning or Deep Learning course. It is also a good way to avoid getting stuck or getting bored.<br/><br/>
Another method I use is splitting courses or book chapters in small sessions or projects of ~1-3 hours. In this way I have more manageable chunks of work and I am more willing to start something new. This also helps with the previous step of combining different resources.<br/><br/>
You can use whatever you want to keep track of your progress. Personally I have a board in Trello to have a quick overview of my progress, check what is pending and quickly find something to work on next. My workflow is quite simple:

1. I add interesting content I find to my 'Backlog'.
2. Then I create small pieces of work based on the resources from step 1, and put them in the 'To Do' column. Ideally they should take between 1 and 3 hours to finish. If it takes longer, chances are that I will not pick the task soon and will be in 'To Do' for a long time.
3. Now I just have to pick an item from 'To Do', transition it to 'In Progress', work on it and finally move it to 'Done' (and celebrate!)
