Summary: My strategy for self-learning


After deciding to pursue a degree in Artificial Intelligence, and with my never-ending list of things I would like to learn, I resolved to teach myself using online resources. This is a first draft of the courses and resources I plan to use, it includes a variety of subjecs from basic to advance to get started in a myriad of topics.


##My Goals

* __Explore new fields__: Probably my main reason for self-study. The world of Computer Science is full of exciting topics, some of which I am curious about, like Deep Learning applied to Medicine, Bioinformatics, Functional Programming, MLOps. 
* __Bring value to my current job__: Improving my knowledge in Python and SQL, or getting started with AIOps.
* __Improve my toolkit__: Polishing my skills with vim, awk, bash, etc.
